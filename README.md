# Tablify Project

Tablify is an application designed to help users visually organize, manage, and share their data in a structured way. The app allows users to create and edit tables, store them under various tabs, and easily export/import content. It is ideal for those who need to manage large amounts of data in a visual format.

## Project Features

1. **Table Structure and Card Design:** Uses a card-based layout to display and organize tables, making data visually accessible and structured.

2. **Table Editing and Deletion Functions:** Users can edit data with multiline support, delete it securely with a confirmation dialog, and make adjustments in a user-friendly environment.

3. **Color Palette:** A theme focused on green tones, creating a visually cohesive design throughout the application.

4. **Copy/Paste Functions (YAML Support):** Enables bulk copy-pasting of data in YAML format, providing a streamlined data transfer experience.

5. **Local Database (SQLite) Integration:** Uses SQLite to securely store data locally on the device, offering an alternative to cloud storage.

6. **Tab Structure:** Each tab can hold different tables, and users can add, rename, and reorder tabs using drag-and-drop functionality.

7. **Export and Import Functions:** Easy-to-use export and import features allow users to transfer data quickly between devices or share it with others.

8. **Language and Name Tag Editor:** An interactive editor for adjusting language and name tags in the text, making it easy to manage metadata.
